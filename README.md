Code and Data Repository for "Neuroevolution gives rise to more focused information transfer compared to backpropagation in recurrent neural networks"

You will find one jupyter notebook file "TransferEntropyExpansionSubproject" containing all data analytical code for the paper, including the deep learning of neural network models.
There are also a couple of .zip file, which contain all necessary data. Please download the entire repository, extract the zip files, and then you can reconstruct the data analysis for this publication.
